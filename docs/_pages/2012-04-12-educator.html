<p>From August 2012 to August 2016, I was seconded on a Teaching Fellowship to Edinburgh University's Moray House. Since August 2016, I have a fixed-term contract with Moray House as Senior Teaching Fellow in Secondary Education (Physics). I teach on the PGDE Primary Science, PGDE Secondary Physics and General Science, Primary BEd, the MA Primary Science strands and the new 2-year MSc in Transformative Learning and Teaching.</p>

<p>I am a GTCS registered teacher of Physics, Science and Mathematics. I took my PGCE at Moray House, graduating in 2004 and serving an unforgettable probationary year at Buckhaven High School, Methil.</p>
<p>From 2005 to 2012, I taught Physics and Mathematics at Kirkcaldy High School with a 2-year secondment as Principal Teacher of Physics at Glenwood High School during 2008-10. During this time I created a number of web resources for pupils and teachers, including "Mr. Hood's World-Wide-Whatsit", which despite having been shut down, parts of it survive in translation - see <a href="http://www.diggreader.ru/2007/06/30/kak-izmerit-skorost-sveta-na-kuhne/" target="_blank">here</a>, for example. There are snapshots at the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070701150823/http://www.mrhood.co.uk/pub/" target="_blank">Internet Archive</a> as well other experiments like an online classroom on <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080828164339/http://mrhood.co.uk/classroom" target="_blank">Moodle</a>. My teacher community site at <a href="http://sptr.net" target="_blank">sptr.net</a> continues to be of service.</p>
<p>I was a marker for the SQA Higher Physics exam in 2012-13 and the Advanced Higher Physics Investigation in 2013.</p>
<p>The Institute of Physics (IoP) is active in supporting education. I served as a member of the <a href="http://www.iopscotland.org/about/branch/page_50545.jsp">IoP in Scotland committee</a> (from September 2011 - September 2014) and am an active member of the IoP's <a href="http://www.iopscotland.org/about/education/index.html">education committee</a> (since February 2010).</p>
<p>Before becoming a teacher, I was often contracted to deliver training courses in industry on programming, databases, object-oriented design and project management. Specific technologies include Microsoft Visual Basic, Access, SQL Server and IIS; Adobe PDF (the language); MySQL; Linux and Apache.</p>
<p>I am able to offer specific technology updates and seminars such as the <a href="http://mrhood.net/channels-of-engagement/">Channels of Engagement</a> half-day workshop for SSERC in 2010. Other CPD delivered includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>2015 <em>Inquiry Graphics</em> for Fife Physics Teachers In-Service Day</li>
<li>2011 <em>Professionally relevant structures</em> A workshop related to CfE</li>
<li>2010 <em>Online survey tools</em> A workshop</li>
<li>2009 <em>The Rank Prize Fund's Optoelectronics College</em>, <a href="http://www.iop.org/events/scientific/conferences/y/09/stirling/index.html">IoP Stirling Meeting</a>, with Michael Walker, Robert Gordon's College</li>
</ul>
