<p>I learned to program a computer in the Army and applied that skill with my avionics knowledge to modelling aircraft systems for pilot training simulators through the latter two decades of the 20th century, eventually setting up my own company. <a href="http://cullaloe.com/files/2012/04/mcsd.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-99" style="border-image: initial; margin: 2px; border: 1px solid black;" title="mcsd" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/mcsd.png" alt="" width="192" height="109" /></a>The business, <em>Cullaloe Project Resource Limited</em>, had offices in Fife and served clients across the UK with technical solutions in a number of public service, industrial and commercial sectors. During this time, I was awarded charter MCP status by Microsoft when I became one of the first in Europe to be accredited as a Microsoft Certified Solution Developer.</p>

From 2010 to 2016 I operated web-based facilities in support of the Physics teaching community in Scotland under the persona of "the Magic Physics Pixies". Membership of the <em>pro bono</em> Scottish Physics Teaching Resources site (<a href="http://sptr.net">sptr.net</a>) exceeded 1200 and served several GigaBytes of resources per month to the benefit of Scotland's secondary physics students. There is a short presentation about sptr <a href="http://sptr.net/blog/a-professional-community-resource/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Recently, I have piloted and run <a href="https://moodle.cullaloe.net/">a Moodle site</a> for PGDE Physics students at Moray House.</p>
<p>The Scottish Government has consulted with a group of technologically competent educators and stakeholders in the development of GLOW, the national schools intranet. I was invited to participate in a number of events associated with this consultation process, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>2010<em> Technologies for learning</em> seminar at the International Futures Forum in Aberdour</li>
<li>2011 <em>ICT in Scottish Education</em> summit at the Stirling Management Centre. <a href="http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/usingglowandict/glow/improvingglow/futureofglow/index.asp">LTS</a> and <a href="http://www.johnconnell.co.uk/blog/?p=2745">others</a> wrote it up.</li>
</ul>
<p>CPD has included technology updates and seminars:</p>
<ul>
<li>2009 <em>Interactive Wii-te board</em>, technology workshop.</li>
<li>2010 <em>Channels of Engagement</em>, a half-day workshop for SSERC</li>
<li>2010 <em>Using New Media in Science Education</em> Scottish Science Education Conference, a workshop with <a href="http://blog.mrmackenzie.co.uk/2010/03/08/scottish-science-education-conference/">Sinclair MacKenzie</a>.</li>
<li>2015 <em><a href="http://sptr.net/blog/a-professional-community-resource/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Magic Physics Pixies - a professional community resource</a></em>, ALT Scotland SIG presentation.</li>
</ul>
