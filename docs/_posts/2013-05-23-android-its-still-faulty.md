Switched my Nexus 7 on today for the first time in a little while today. I've got to the point now where I don't use it much, as it's such a flaky piece of junk. I can't be relying on flaky pieces of junk. This is what I saw:

It's still faulty. Same fault I returned it for back in November. And again twice more since. This is seriously the worst product service I have ever had. And that's coming from a guy who once bought a Lada. Get it sorted, please, Asus.
