This is a Python script to walk a directory tree, renaming .jpg and .JPG files. It was written for a client who had a directory containing multiple directories, each containingÂ zero or more (up to 100) image files. Most of the images were named &lt;abitrary name 1&gt;.jpg or &lt;arbitrary name 2&gt;.JPG.

The client wanted each folder's images to be numbered 001.jpg to nnn.jpg for some further process.

```python
import os
import imghdr

def renamefiles(path):
rootstructure=os.path.abspath(path)
n = 0
for root, dirs, files in os.walk(rootstructure):
for f in files:
if os.getcwd() != root:
n = 0 # Reset the counter
os.chdir(root)

type = imghdr.what(f)
if type == 'jpeg':
n +=1
os.rename(f, str(n).zfill(3) + ".jpg")
```

```sh
# Specify the full path to the directory here.
$ renamefiles("/Users/myuser/Desktop/TheImageFolder")
```
